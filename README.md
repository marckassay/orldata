# OrlData

 An Angular app that syndicates to ['Orlando's Open Data'](https://data.cityoforlando.net/) services. This application has been developed
 with [Angular](https://angular.io/) 8.0 with [NgRx](https://ngrx.io/) for state management, and also [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) for UI components.

 The services are provided by [Socrata](https://dev.socrata.com/)'s DaaS platform using their "rich query functionality" through a query language that they refer to as "Socrata Query Language" or "SoQL".

 The UI design comes from refactoring Angular Material's website into this app. As my objective for this app was to utilize Material
 components, and not to per se design a website.

 Hosting is provided by Azure cloud services.
